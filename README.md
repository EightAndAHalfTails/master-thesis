# Hardware-based Buffer Overflow Protection

This repository comprises part of the work for my Final Year Project and Master's Thesis for MEng Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial College London. This project was undertaken during my Erasmus year in Europe, under the supervision of Prof. Guillaume Duc of the SEN (Digital Electronic Systems) group at Télécom Paristech, Paris, France.

The full project, including the modified hardware code, has been moved to https://github.com/EightAndAHalfTails/mor1kx/tree/dmmumod
